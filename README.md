LINK: https://sage-travesseiro-328dff.netlify.app/


*A hassle-free expense manager for trips and group outings. Pool your money first, then track your spending. No more chasing friends for money!*

### üí° The Problem

Remember those amazing trips with friends? And the not-so-amazing part afterward? Manually tracking who paid for what‚Äîhotels, food, cabs‚Äîand then spending weeks trying to settle up using apps like Splitwise. Someone pays back in 3 days, someone in 3 weeks, and you're left chasing the rest. It‚Äôs a hassle that adds a sour note to great memories.

**Pool-n-Pay** is designed to eliminate this problem entirely by flipping the model: **pool your money first, then spend.**

### ‚ú® How It Works: A Simple Flow

1. **Sign In:** Users securely sign in with their Google account.
2. **Welcome:** You're greeted with a personalized welcome screen.
3. **Create or Join:**
    - **Create a Pool:** Give your trip or event a name (e.g., "Goa Trip 2025") to create a new, shared expense pool.
    - **Join a Pool:** Get a unique Pool ID from a friend and paste it in to join their existing pool.
4. **Pool In:** Once in the pool, everyone contributes their share to the central pot. The dashboard updates in real-time, showing the total amount collected.
5. **Track Spending:** As the group spends money on activities, food, or travel, any member can add an expense. The app deducts the amount from the total pool and updates the remaining balance for everyone to see.
6. **Settle Up:** At the end of the trip, the pool owner marks the trip as "Complete." The app calculates the final remaining balance and shows how much each member gets back.

### üöÄ Key Features
